Thank you all for joining this morning. My name is Won Lee, and I am a quantitative researcher at Center for research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University.   

I am presenting a paper that examines the effect of single-sex schools on student outcomes using data from city of Seoul, South Korea. The goal of this study is to estimate the how gender composition at school affect student outcomes, both academic and non-academic outcomes. If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interupt me at any time.

To give you some background, the  advantages and disadvantages of SS schooling on student outcomes has been widely discussed, many studies have examined the effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes.<br> <br> 

Yet, there are no clear consensus on its effects and its implication, Meta-analysis on the literature finds larger portion of studies finds positive effect, and recent quasi-experimental studies generally find positive effect on student's academic outcomes, with effect size ranges between  0.05 to 0.2 SD. <br> <br>  
<br>
Critics argue that positive effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes are grounded in weak scientific evidence and SS schools may lead to negative consequences such as gender stereotyping and sexism.<br>
<br>  
One of the threats to causal inference in the SS education literature has been the non-random selection of students to the SS schools that cause systematic difference in student characteristics between SS and coeducational schools.

To address the non-random selection problem, one of the common instruments that are widely used in Korean Context is the Equalization policy of South Korea., which is a lottery-based enrollment system that randomly assigns middle and high-school students within school-districts of their residence.
<br>  <br>  
The policy has been implemented since 1970s to establish a uniform educational environment across the country and prevent schools from discriminating against students based on their previous academic performance or socio-economic status.


<br><br>  
Designed to provide a homogeneous educational environment across the country.
<br> <br>  
Given that this policy applies to all middle school students in the city of Seoul, Compliance to the policy is high. The only way to transfer from undesired school assignment is to relocate to a different school district, where a student will once again subject to another random assignment among schools within the new district.
<br> 
Many studies have used equalization policy of South Korea to examine the effect of SS education, but, the key weakness of the previous studies that rely on this policy instrument, is that most of these studies use cross-sectional data that are unable to test the pre-treatment balance, the baseline equivalence of those who enrolls to SS and coeducation schools. 
<br> 
One contribution of this study, is that this study address the issue by leveraging student-level panel data to see if the two groups are equal in expectations in observables prior to the assignment to each typs of schools.

			<aside class="notes">
The purpose of this study is to find out the effect of SS schooling on student outcomes, and explore possible mechanisms of the effect using student-level panel data. I also plan to examine the effect on non-academic outcomes using the survey data.

This paper makes three key contributions to the literature. 
<br> 
<br>   
First one is the fact that this study uses panel data to assess the impact of SS education on student outcomes. As I just mentioned, Previous studies in Korean context were constrained as they relied on cross-sectional data, due to the nature of the data, these studies could not ensure the pre-treatment balance to verify the randomness assumption of the assignment. Since I am relying on the panel data, I can actually assess the randomness of the policy instrument that are essential for establishing causal interpretation.
<br> 
<br>   
Secondly, this paper examines the effect of SS education on non-academic outcomes. Since I am using the unique survey data that asks about the students' behavioral outcomes, this study allows me to explore effects of SS education on non-academic outcomes that were not previously examined in the literature. 
<br> 
<br>
latly, this is the first study that examines the impact of Single-Sex (SS) schooling on students during the transition to SS middle schools. Prior research primarily concentrated on the effects of SS schooling for high school students. Due to developmental variations in age, the dynamics of peer interactions may differ between middle school and high school students.

I use one cohort data in this study who are in 4th graders in 2010 and becomes 9th graders in 2016. the survey sampled 3,500 students from City of Seoul. The data collection uses Two-stage cluster random sampling method, randomly selected 289 schools and two classes within each selected school. 

<br> 
<br>   
The information collected by the survey pertains to multiple dimensions of students’
educational environment, and data are also collected from parents, teachers. The survey was conducted in July of each year, before the start of the summer vacation. The SELS conducted academic skill assessments for Korean, English, and math in each year of the survey. Each test lasted for 40 or 45 minutes per subject, and each test was comprised of 25-35 multiple-choice questions for elementary and middle school students, respectively, and designed to test the curriculum covered in class during the first half of the semester.

<br> To address systematic differences between students attending SS schools and coeducational schools, I conducted a matching on observables to ensure that the two groups of students are closely matched in terms of their observed
characteristics. and in addition use difference-in-difference methods to eliminate further unobserved heterogeneity that might be present.

	This table shows the summary of student characteristics when students are 6th grade, so this is one year before they get proceeds to middle school, which is either SS or coeducational. <br><br> If you look at the numbers on the top Panel. Panel A, There is no statistically significant difference in many important characteristics such as family income.<br><br>  But, students who go to SS schools have higher test scores in the year before the transition than the students go to coed, and mother have higher levels of education,<br><br>  which suggests that the school assignment process is not entirely random.
	<br><br>

	<br>
	One possible channel for this selection is that, In Seoul, school districts are organized into two or three administrative sub-districts. The likelihood of being assigned to a particular type of school within one administrative sub-district is likely to be higher compared to another sub-district. This could mean the assignment is random at the district level, but not at the sub-district level. so certain parents and students may be attracted to districts with a greater number of SS schools.   


<br>
I order to correct for the difference in observables, I conduct matching to achieve covariate balance between the two group. The Pabel B of this table confirms improved balance for test score and mother’s education variables. 
I use these matched sample for the further analysis.

The Panel A of this table shows the estimated coefficients on the SS education using the data prior to matching. If you look at the estimates under naive OLS models in columns (1) and (5), SS education has a positive effect on all subjects for girls and boys.<br><br> The effects for boys disappear when effects are estimated based on DID model, and pre-trends dummies are negative and statistically significant for boys, suggesting the there might be an selection based on the academic performance prior to the middle school transition.

The panel B shows the results for the matched sample. We observed that effect remains for girls Korean and English scores, but effect completely disappears for boys (except English). 
<br>
But, Even after matching on student observables, there might be systematic difference in school-level characteristics that might affect the student outcomes, so I aim to address these factors in the next slide.

<br>
so, if the SS schools are characteristically different from co-educational schools, the effects we show in the previous slides may not simply boil down to a peer effect. As a robustness check, I integrate school-level
characteristics to account for systematic school-level differences between the schools, this includes number of students, expenditures per student, number of full-time teacher, and student-teacher ratio.


As shown in this table, the inclusion of these school characteristics as controls does not appear to change the primary estimates. 
<br><br>
There is a possibility that systematic differences in teacher quality, and other unobservable factors related to the autonomy that exist between the two types of schools. Even though teacher sorting doesn’t occur within public schools, as teachers are periodically reassigned to schools within a school district, private schools, which make up 85% of single-sex schools in Seoul, enjoy greater autonomy in their teacher hiring processes (Hahn, Wang and Yang, 2018). If higher-quality teachers tend to opt for private single-sex schools, it is possible that the observed effects in my analysis could be influenced by this systematic disparity in teacher quality. To further ensure the robustness of my findings, I conducted an additional analysis where I excluded private single-sex schools from the dataset and focused solely on public coeducational and single-sex schools. This approach addresses concerns about teacher selection bias. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 6, which consistently demonstrates the positive effect of single-sex schools on girls.

This table looks into the attrition rate of the sample, just to ensure that compositional changes at the school-level doesn't coufound the estimates of the effect.
In 2013, there are 2,960 unique students in the middle school. This 14.5% attrition rate may cause systematic shift in the student demographic and influence the outcomes of interest. The most attrition during the study window took place between 2012 and 2013 when there was a elementary to middle school transition. The table below suggests that there were no systematic change in the student characteristics due to the attrition. I have also conducted the key analysis using the balanced panel where the
attrition is not an issue, and verified that the main insight remains the same.

In the next couple of slides, I will quickly show you the trends in the survey responses regarding the school experience, which is suggestive of explanation for underlying mechanism for stronger positive effect for Girls.
The figures on the top show that the share of female students who respond that their English class are disorderly is much lower among students in SS school than the students in coed. for boys, the patter is less clear, but Disorderly class is actually higher in some years for SS group than the students in coeducational schools.


Similar trend is observed for Math class in the middle.  

The two figures at the bottom pertains to the question on peer behaviors and it is exclusively measured in the middle schools, but, these trends suggest descriptively that students in SS schools tend to rate their peers more positively in terms of the peers delienquent behaviors

This table shows the effects of SS schooling on other non-academic outcomes, peer behavior on bullying, misbehavior and delinquency. The estimates suggest that students in SS schools are less likely to report disruptive behaviors among their peers which hinder the learning environment. Although the effects are consistent in direction and significance for both girls’ and boys’ schools, they are notably more pronounced among students in girls-only schools. This aligns with the earlier discussion highlighting the positive impact of SS schooling on girls’ academic outcomes.

To summarize, This study examines effect of SS schooling in Middle school on students outcomes using student-level panel data from Seoul.  <br>    <br>  
This is the first study that uses within-student variation in the academic achievement to identify causal effect of SS school  <br>    <br>  
The results suggest that SS schooling have positive effect for girls while small or null effect was found for boys.   <br>    <br>  
This finding is consistent with studies that are based on RCT in the peer effects literature that generally finds positive effect of increasing share of female students on academic outcomes and no effect for male students.

 Reduced distraction from "adolescent subculture" (Coleman, 1961)

Concerning the mechanism, Based on student and parents response on multiple questions on their school experience, SS school environment that are more academically focused.  <br>    <br>  
I think these observations from the data are consistent with Coleman's reduced distraction from adolescent subculture hypothesis.
  
  <br>  

  so overall, results from this study suggests that the single-sex education can have positive impacts on students, especially for girls. Proponents of SS education have argued that it can reduce gender stereotypes, promote a gender-customized currilcula, and boost confidence in some subjects such as STEM for girls. However, it is important to weigh these advantages against the potential drawbacks of single-sex education, such as promoting sexism and gender inequality via gender-based segregation, and reduced opportunity for collaboration.  


  <br>  
   <br>  
   Thhank you. 
  <br>  
   <br>  

In theory, holding other schooling attributes fixed, single-sex education may improve outcomes because single-sex classrooms may (a) allow for instruction tailored to the specific needs of each sex, (b) allow teachers to focus better on instruction, and (c) reove opposite-sex peers who may affect social dynamics in ways that are deleterious to student outcomes (Jackson, 2019).
