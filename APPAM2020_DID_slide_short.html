To give you some background, the merits of SS schooling has been widely discussed, and there are many studies that examines the effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes.<br> <br> 

There are no clear consensus regarding the direction or size of the effect, but studies generally find positive effect on student's academic outcomes. <br> <br> 
Especially, recent  quasi-experimental studies suggests the effects ranges between 0.05 to 0.2 SD.
<br>
Critics argue that positive effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes are grounded in weak scientific evidence and SS schools may lead to negative consequences such as gender stereotyping and sexism.<br>
<br>  
One of the threats to causal inference in the SS school literature has been the non-random selection of students to the SS schools and systematic difference between SS and coeducational schools.

To address the non-random selection problem in the literature, many studies have used equalization policy of South Korea, which randomly assigns middle and high-school students within school-districts of their residence.
<br>  <br>  
The policy has been implemented since 1970s in response to the growing pressure on middle school entrance exam in the 1960s<br>  <br>  
Designed to provide a homogeneous educational environment across the country.
<br> <br>  
   <br>  
Compliance to the policy is high. Applies to all middle school students in Seoul.

If you look at some relevant previous studies that use South Korean data, they leverage the random assignment policy in Seoul  to estimate the effect of SS school on college entrance exam.<br> 

<br> 


they generally find positive effect of SS schooling for both boys and girls.
<br> 
They all use cross- or pooled-sectional data
<br> 
Due to lack of data, no studies have shown the balance check to validate the credibility of random assignment policy.
<br> 
and none of them test the underlying mechanism.


<br> 
<br>

The purpose of this study is to examine effect of SS schooling on student outcomes in middle school and explore possible mechanisms of the effect using student-level panel data. I also plan to examine the effect on non-academic outcomes using the survey data.

				I use annually surveyed student-level panel data from city of Seoul (Seoul Education Longitudinal Study (SELS)). 

<br> 
I use one cohort data in this study who are in 4th grade in 2010 and becomes 9th graders in 2016. Sampled 5,000 students from City of Seoul.

For identification strategy, I rely on the equalization policy, the random assignment policy, <br> 
<br> I test the credibility of this assumption by checking pre-treatment balance using the panel data. <br> 
<br> I also conduct matching and difference-in-difference methods to eliminate further unobserved heterogeneity that might be present.

The table shows the estimated coefficients on the SS education using the full sample, this is sample before matching.  based on the OLS model, SS education has a positive effect on all subjects for both boys and girls.<br><br> The effects for boys disappear when effects are estimated based on DID model, and pre-trends dummies are negative and statistically significant for boys, suggesting the there might be an selection based on the academic performance prior to the middle school transition. 

<br><br>


The 4th row of each panel shows the estimated effect of SS on overall average test scores. The effects are quite consistent and shows 0.1 SD positive effect for girls for both OLS and DID model, but the effects goes away for boy in the DID.

To summarize, This study examines effect of SS schooling in Middle school on students outcomes using student-level panel data from Seoul.  <br>    <br>  
This is the first study that uses within-student variation in the academic achievement to identify causal effect of SS school  <br>    <br>  
The results suggest that SS schooling have positive effect for girls while null effect was found for boys.   <br>    <br>  
This finding is consistent with studies that are based on RCT in the peer effects literature that generally finds positive effect of increasing share of female students on academic outcomes and no effect for male students.

 Reduced distraction from adolescent subculture" (Coleman, 1961)

  					</ul>
			<aside class="notes">

Concerning the mechanism, Based on student and parents response on multiple questions on their school experience, SS school environment that are more academically focused.  <br>    <br>  
I think these observations from the data are consistent with Coleman's reduced distraction from adolescent subculture hypothesis.
 

  <br>  
But, these are preliminary, and as a next step, I plan to conduct mediation analysis to say more about the mechanisms.

  <br>  
  <br>  
  <br>  
In theory, holding other schooling attributes fixed, single-sex education may improve outcomes because single-sex classrooms may (a) allow for instruction tailored to the specific needs of each sex, (b) allow teachers to focus better on instruction, and (c) reove opposite-sex peers who may affect social dynamics in ways that are deleterious to student outcomes (Jackson, 2019). 



  <br>  

About 13 percent of schools in Korea are private, most at the secondary school level, private schools receive public funding. In return, they dont charge school fees for compulsory education and cannot charge higher fees for upper secondary than those public schools charge. Private schools adhere to the national curriculum and teachers are required to meet the same standards for teacher certification. 

The key difference is that teachers are employed directly by the school rather than by the Ministry which means that they are not required to rotate among schools, as are public school teachers. 
 
 School funding is very centrailzed, with the Ministry of Education providing more than 75 percent of school funding.
