Extensive studies have examined the pros and cons of SS schooling.<br> <br> 

But, There are no clear consensus regarding the direction or size of the effect, but recent studies that rely on quasi-experimental methods suggests the effects on academic outcome ranges between 0.05 to 0.2 SD.
<br> 
<br>  
There has been lack of studies that looked at the effect on the non-academic outcomes. As far as I know there is only one recent study show SS schooling have effect on reducing teen arrests and pregnancy rates.
<br>
<br>   
In this study, I aim to estimate the effect of SS schooling on student outcomes, both academic and non-academic using the panel data from city of Seoul.

I use annually surveyed student-level panel data. It's one cohort data who are in 4th graders in 2010 and becomes 9th graders in 2016. Sample size about 4000 students.

<br> 
<br> 

To address the selection, I rely on the Equalization policy, which randomly assigns middle and high-school students within school-districts of their residence.
<br>  <br>  
The policy has been implemented since 1970s and compliance to the policy is high, and it applies to all middle school students in Seoul.
<br> 
 
<br> I test the credibility of the randomness assumption by checking pre-treatment balance using the panel data. <br> 
<br>I found some evidence in the data that high performing student select themselves into SS schools. <br> 
<br>So, I use matching and difference-in-difference methods to eliminate further unobserved heterogeneity that might be present.

	Preliminary Results 
					</p>
		  <img data-src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leex5089/revealjs_slide/master/figures/result_table.PNG" height="600" width="762" style="border: none; background: none; box-shadow:none"> 

  

	<aside class="notes">
This table summarizes preliminary results estimated using matched sample, so SS and coed group are balanced in student and family characteristics prior to the middle school.  There are three panels in the table, looking at difference set of outcomes,<br><br> Panel.A shows effect on academic outcome which is a test score that averages math, reading, korean test scores together. You can see the coeffcient on the SS schooling is about 1.5 SD for girls and shows null effect for boys. 


<br><br> 

 To examine the effect of SS schooling on the non-academic outcomes, I rely on the survey responses rated in terms of 5 point Likert scale. 


<br><br> 
The survey question asks to rate level of disorderliness in English  and  Math  classroom,  The  results in Panel B shows  that  SS  schooling  reduces studentsâ€™ rating on class disruption, which means lower disruption in the class. The effects are stronger in girls  only schools. 


<br><br> 

Results in panel C suggests  students  in  SS  school  are  less  likely  to  report  that  their  peers  show behaviors that are disruptive to learning such as bullying,  mis-bahavior,  and delinquency. Similar to the results in Panel B, the  stronger effects are found among students in girls-only schools.
 <br><br>


To summarize,  The results suggest that SS schooling have positive effect for girls academic outcomes while null effect was found for boys.   <br>    <br>  
There seems to be some evidence that SS schooling improves the non-academic outcomes for both girls and boys, but stronger effects are found among girls only school. This finding is consistent with studies that are based on RCT in the peer effects literature which finds positive effect of increasing share of female students on academic outcomes.  <br>    <br>  
Lavy and Schlosser (2011)

  <br>    <br>  
In terms of next steps, I am planning to add a section on mediation analysis to test how peer and school ratings affect the academic outcomes.
  <br>    <br>  


Concerning the mechanism, Based on student and parents response on multiple questions on their school experience, SS school environment that are more academically focused.  <br>    <br>  
I think these observations from the data are consistent with Coleman's reduced distraction from adolescent subculture hypothesis.


This is the first study that uses within-student variation in the academic achievement to identify causal effect of SS school  <br>    <br>  


 
 
  <br>  
  <br>  
  <br>  
In theory, holding other schooling attributes fixed, single-sex education may improve outcomes because single-sex classrooms may (a) allow for instruction tailored to the specific needs of each sex, (b) allow teachers to focus better on instruction, and (c) reove opposite-sex peers who may affect social dynamics in ways that are deleterious to student outcomes (Jackson, 2019). 



  <br>  

About 13 percent of schools in Korea are private, most at the secondary school level, private schools receive public funding. In return, they dont charge school fees for compulsory education and cannot charge higher fees for upper secondary than those public schools charge. Private schools adhere to the national curriculum and teachers are required to meet the same standards for teacher certification. 

The key difference is that teachers are employed directly by the school rather than by the Ministry which means that they are not required to rotate among schools, as are public school teachers. 
 
 School funding is very centrailzed, with the Ministry of Education providing more than 75 percent of school funding.
