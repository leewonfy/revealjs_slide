To provide some background,
<br>
<br>
Parental preferences for gender of child has been documented in many cultures, there are lots of studies that shows strong son preference among parents in South and East Asian countries.
<br><br>
More recent studies show that there are some evidence of son preferences in developed countries as well, although there are more heterogeneity in the preferences.
<br><br>
Nordic countries have shown to have preference for girls. and a study shows girl preference has been growing over the past 10 years in Sweden.

These studies generally suggest that there is a link between the parental preferences and parental input or child outcomes. 

<br> <br> 
For example, Girls in India are less likely to be vaccinated and received less nutrition at age of 1 and 2, less likely to be breastfed, and receive child care time from parents.

<br> <br> 
Studies also find,  Girls in China receive less educational opportunities.
<br> <br> 
And Girls in South Korea receive less investment from parents on academic private education.

I will talk little bit about how the inference on parental preferences for sex of child are commonly made in the literature.
<br> 
<br> 

Fertility statistics such as Sex-ratio at a country or region level has been used to draw inference on region specific parental preference 
<br> 
<br> 

Another common measure is the likelihood of another birth conditional on sex of previous children. 
<br> 

<br> 
And many studies compare boy-girl difference in parental input  <br> <br> 
and 
some studies use Noisy measures of parental preference, these studies typically combine responses to questions such as
<br> <br> 

 “how many children do you want to have?” and “How many of these children would you like to be boys or Girls?” 
 <br> 
 and infer the preference based on the composition.

					The aggregate measures (across sex of child) overlook important family-level heterogeniety in preferences:

					<ul style="color:#000000; font-size:0.8em">

					<li  >
					In U.S., where the sex-ratio is 1.05, the biologically normal sex-ratio without any interference, there exists clear preferences for the sex of children.

Problem with these measures of parental preferences is that they ignores important family-level heterogeneity in preference, for example, in U.S, sex-ratio is 1.05, 
<br> 
<br> 
biologically normal sex-ratio and based on this measure, one can concludes that parents in U.S. is gender-neutral, whereas in fact, according to the Gallop poll survey, 19% of men prefer to have daughter and 48% prefer to have son.<br> <br> 
35% women prefers daughter and 30% prefers son. <br> <br> 

studies that rely on the aggregate fertility data requires the strong assumption of homogeneous preferences within the area of interest.<br><br>

The problem is illustrated in this simple matrix, group 1 has strong preference for sex of their child and allocates parental input accordingly. 
<br><br> 

If the sex of child is what they expect, they allocate input of 1, and zero otherwise. 
<br><br> 

In group 2, they are gender-neutral and allocates same input level regardless of the sex of their child. The problem is that expectation of input conditional on sex of child will be at 0.5 for both group 1 and group 2. 
<br><br> 

And size of the effect of parental preferences for group 1 has been attenuated.

I use sex of the first-born child as a source of identification, the fact that parents can’t control the sex of their child regardless of their preference. This is arguably true given the recent trend in decline in son preference and abortion in South Korea. <br><br> 
 
Y is the outcome variables such as cognitive outcome of child at age 4, and parental inputs including duration of breast feeding, non-parental care at the year of birth and mother’s depression score.<br><br> 


PP are the three dummy variables for the types of parent preference.    .<br>

3 if both parents don't have any preference<br><br>

 There are fourth category which is parental preferences is mixed where mother and father preferences differ, I exclude these sample from the main analysis as the interpretation of the estimates are ambiguous, but I have ran the analysis both including and excluding them and the it doesn’t affect the main results that I am showing. <br>

Delta is the parameter of interest that esimtate the effect of PP. <br><br>

This table compares child and parents characteristics by the sex of the first-born child.  <br><br> To mention some of the key variables, mothers’average age is 30. <br> <br>Approximately 35% of mothers were working , and about 16% of new-borns are in non-parental care in the year of their birth. <br> <br> Child-related expenses account for about 30% of total household expenditure. <br> Almost all variables examined are not statistically different by the sex of the child, which again supports the randomness of the sex of the child that is the key identifying assumption. <br><br>

When preference is aggregated, there is no large expenditure difference by the sex of child. parents spend amoutn 600 dollars on child, although spending is little higher for girls on average. 

<br><br>When broken down by parental preferences in the figure on the right, the difference in the expenditure on child is more pronounced depending on the sex of child. 

<br><br> Parents with son preference whose first-born
child is a girl spend 14 percent less than the parents with son preference whose

This table shows the effects of parental preferences on parental inputs.

<br>

<br>
The results in the first column of the table suggests that the parents’ sex preference of their child and child sex is not highly predictive of the mother’s  likelihood  of  breast  feeding  her  first  born  child. Althogh the signs are as expected, that breast-feeding duration is longer if the sex of the child is same as the preference, the estimates are not statistically signficant.
<br><br>
A similar pattern appears for the probability of non-parental care  in  the  first  year  after  birth. Boys born to  parents with girl preference are more likely to spend time in the non-parental care in the first year their birth compared to boys born to parents with son preference.  <br><br>On the contrary, the likelihood of girls being in non-parental care born to the parents with girl preference is lower compared to the girls born to the parents with son preference, 
<br><br>
This suggests parents whose  sex of their first-born matches their preference tend to look after the new-born by themselves. 

<br><br>
  I examine how the parental preferences affect the mother’s self-response to the questions pertains to their psychological state in column 3 and 4.
<br><br>
 The results suggest that the depression score is positively related with mothers who have girls but whose preference was for a boy, while negatively related for parents with preference for girls or preference for other than son preference.

Using direct measure of parental preferences for sex of first-born child, this study examines the whether there is a causal link between the parental preferences and parental inputs and cognitive outcomes. 
  <br>  
  <br>  
 This is the first study that uses parent-level preference measures that are highly relevant to the child in the data as the preference was directly measured through the questions to the mother when the child was born.
  <br>  <br>


I find suggestive evidence that the parent preference have statistically significant effect on the parental input and child cognitive outcome.
  <br><br>
Girls born to parents that favor girls have a 0.5 standard deviation higher receptive language score than girls born to parents with a preference for sons. 
  <br>  

I find no evidence that parental preferences have effect on boys language score.
  <br>  <br>
  

   
  <br>  <br>
  In terms of implication, This study suggests that the social effort on reduction of postnatal bias by parents might be important to reduce gender discrimination.

The pros and cons of SS schooling has been long debated topic internationally.<br> <br> 

There is no clear consensus in the effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes, but studies that review the literature suggests marority of studies find positive effect. <br> <br> 

Critics argue that positive effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes are grounded in weak scientific evidence and SS schools can engender negative consequences such as gender stereotyping and sexism.<br>
<br>  
Threats to causal inference in the  SS school literature, especially in the U.S. context has been the non-random selection of students to the SS schools and systematic difference between SS and coeducational schools.

I am going to list out a number of relevant previous studies that estimated the effect of SS schools using South Korean data to give you some context. 
<br> <br> 
In the first paper, they use the random assignment policy in Seoul as natural experiment to find the effect of SS school on college entrance exam.<br> 
<br>  They use cross-sectional data and finds positive effect of SS on Korean and English test scores for both girls and boys.<br> <br>  Due to lack of data, they don’t actually test the mechanism, but suggests that sex-composition of teacher might have contributed to the positive effect, that more teachers of same gender are in the SS schools than the public schools.

Chronic absenteeism is defiend as, missing 15 or more school days within a school year, according to 2016 report from the department of education, 3.1 million elementary students are chronically absent, which is about 10% of total elementary students in U.S. 

<br> 
Chronic Absenteeism is found to be correlated with numerous negative outcomes for both individual and the community. 

<br> 
	At the individual-level, it is found to be correlated with lower academic performance, anti-social behavior, substance abuse and negative labor market outcomes

 

<br> 
<br> 
	At the community-level, all these negative outcomes for individauls can lead to lower tax revenue and higher crime rates

Has been implemented in the Ramsey county for almost 20 years.
<br> 

<br> 

Approximately 500 elementary students who are referred to the program annually.
<br> 

The program is relatively low-cost, but involves participation of multiple parties.
this study is especially relevent and timely, as the court-diversion type program that we are evaluating is widely used across the school districts in U.S., about 60% are implementing the court-diversion programs, and recently, state of Texas and Tennessee mandated that all school districts implement court-diversion programs before petitioning to court for truancy case.

For the evaluation of the program, We use 12 years of student-year level data from multiple state agencies including department of education, department of human services, the unique feature of this dataset is that the multiple state agency data is linked across individuals over time, so it gives relatively rich information about the individual’s attendance history, academic performance as well as family background.
 
<br>

We also use daily absentieesm data from five school-districts in the program county that distinquished unexcused from excused absences. Since we only have this data for the program county, we use this data to examine the short-term monthly-level effect of the program within an academic-year as a robustness check of the main results. 

<br>

And finally, we use program data from county attorney's office with information on referral dates.

<aside class="notes">
The program consists of three-steps.

<br>
<br>
first step is the large group parent meeting after a student makes 5 or more unexcused absences, at the parent meeting, county attorney provide information about the negative consequences of the continued school absences, information about the program and eventual legal consequences. 

<br>
<br>
After the first meeting, students' attendances are closely monitored by the school and those who makes additional 5 or more unexcused absnneces are referred to 2nd step of the program, where students and parents meet with county attorneys and community counselors where they try to find more detail cause of the continued truancy and form a written contract to improve the attendance. 

<br>
<br>
If the unexcused abnseces continue after the  2nd step, the final step of the program involves referral to the child protection office or family-court, where parents may be court-ordered to comply with a case plan developed by court.

For identification strategy, we construct comparison group through matching on pre-treatment individual-level characteristics. The comparison pool come from the adjacent county that did not have the similarly structured program, but faces very similar macro and demographic trends. 
 

<br>
The matching process ensures that the comparison group is characteristically quite similar to the treatment on all the observables. 

<br>
<br>
After mathcing, there still remains a room for selection on unobservables, such as student motivation and behavior, or parental support, we use difference-in-difference method that leverages the panel data which difference out the time invariant unobservables in the error term.

This table compares the intervention condition between the Ramsey and the comparison county. 
<br>
The key difference between the program and the comparison county was the systematic intervention by the county attorney’s office after five unexcused absences. In the comparison county, school personnel reported educational neglect directly to the county’s department of human services after seven or more unexcused absences. 
<br><br>The department of human services investigated the case, and made a determination as to whether to close the case, offer the parents voluntary case management, or petition the parent(s) to court.
<br><br>
In the comparison county, educational neglect was unlikely to be reported until it had escalated to a substantial number of days because school staff did not want to involve child protection services unless they deemed the situation to be very serious.

To give you some idea on who is being referred to the program.
<br>
This table compares the student characteristics between referred and non-referred group in the program county. 

<br>Here the referred group are the 2nd to 5th graders who were referred to the program between 2006-2009, so there were fifteen-hundred(1500) referred students during the period and 60,000 non-referred students.
<br>
Not surprisingly, the referred students are quite difference from the rest of the population in terms of socio-demographic and school characteristics, 
<br>
attendance rate of referred group is much lower,
<br>

<br>
referred group are more likely to be free-lunch eligible, 89% of referred groups are free-lunch eligible, compared to 43% non-referred group, 

<br>
<br>
appriximately half of the referred students were Black students and students of color comprised nearly 82% of the total referred group, compared to 52% of the non-referred group.

This plot shows the covariate balance between the treated and comparison group, before and after the matching for group who was referred in 2nd grade.
Y axis is the list of variables that we check covariate balance in the matching. X-axis is the standardized mean difference.
<br>

Red dots represent covariate balance before matching. Blue dots after matching. 
<br>
So in general red dots are quite scattered, which suggests that before matching, there are large characteristics difference between treated and comparison group.
<br>
the purpose of matching is to eliminate these large differences in group characteristics and contain differences under the conventional level of threshold, which is represented by the outter dotted vertical line. 
<br>
One can see that compared to red dots, blue dots are mostly contained within the threshold, which confirms quality of matching is good interms of covariate balance.

Tne concerns about the main analysis is that
  <br>
yearly attendance rate we used for the anlaysis aggregates excused/unexcused absences, so if the referred students had disproportionately higher unexcused absneces relative to the comparison group, our estimator could be biased downward. 

<br><br>
Also, The fact that we are using the attendance rate in the year of referral as a matching variable may be problematic because it contain a partial treatment effect.

<br><br>
To address this concern, 
we use daily attendance data from program county, the advantage of using the daily attendance data is that we have data on excused and unexcused absences, so this allows us to conduct matching based on unexucsed abseces.

<br><br>

Also, we are able to conduct matching using the pre-referral monthly absence data.

To summarize the study, The results of our study shows that the program did not have a positive effect on improving the attendance of the referred students, either in the short-term or up to four years after program referral.
<br>
<br>
We observe some degree of "regression to the mean" or transitory nature of absence, suggesting absence is often clustered at certain points in time within the academic year.  we argue that this is the important issue to be addressed in any types of evaluation study of absentieesm intervention program. <br>   <br> <br>  
  The magnitude of bias may be larger when the follow-up period is limited to short period of time, especially within a school year.
