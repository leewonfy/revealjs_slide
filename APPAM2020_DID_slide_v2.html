To give you some background, the merits of SS schooling has been widely discussed, and there are many studies that examines the effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes.<br> <br> 

There are no clear consensus regarding the direction or size of the effect, but studies generally find positive effect on student's academic outcomes. <br> <br> 
Especially, recent  quasi-experimental studies also suggest positive effects on the academic outcomes, size of the effects varies widely, but it ranging up to 0.05 to 0.2 SD increaase in the test scores.
<br>
Critics argue that positive effect of SS schooling on academic outcomes are grounded in weak scientific evidence and SS schools can engender negative consequences such as gender stereotyping and sexism.<br>
<br>  
Threats to causal inference in the  SS school literature, especially in the U.S. context has been the non-random selection of students to the SS schools and systematic difference between SS and coeducational schools.

To address the non-random selection problem in the literature, many studies have used equalization policy of South Korea, which randomly assigns middle and high-school students within school-districts of their residence.
<br>  <br>  
The policy has been implemented since 1970s in response to the growing pressure on middle school entrance exam in the 1960s<br>  <br>  
Designed to provide a homogeneous educational environment across the country.
<br> <br>  
And prohibit schools from selecting students based on academic performance or socio-economic status<br>  <br>  
Compliance to the policy is high. Applies to all middle and high school students in Seoul.

This is the first study that uses within-student variation in the academic achievement to identify causal effect of SS school  <br>    <br>  
The results suggest that SS schooling have positive effect for girls while null effect was found for boys.   <br>    <br>  
This finding is consistent with studies that are based on RCT in the peer effects literature that generally finds positive effect of increasing share of female students on academic outcomes and no effect for male students.

Concerning the mechanism, Based on student and parents response on multiple questions on their school experience, SS school environment that are more academically focused.  <br>    <br>  
I think these observations from the data are consistent with Coleman's reduced distraction from adolescent subculture hypothesis.
 
In theory, holding other schooling attributes fixed, single-sex education may improve outcomes because single-sex classrooms may (a) allow for instruction tailored to the specific needs of each sex, (b) allow teachers to focus better on instruction, and (c) reove opposite-sex peers who may affect social dynamics in ways that are deleterious to student outcomes (Jackson, 2019).

About 13 percent of schools in Korea are private, most at the secondary school level, private schools receive public funding. In return, they dont charge school fees for compulsory education and cannot charge higher fees for upper secondary than those public schools charge. Private schools adhere to the national curriculum and teachers are required to meet the same standards for teacher certification. 

The key difference is that teachers are employed directly by the school rather than by the Ministry which means that they are not required to rotate among schools, as are public school teachers. 
 
 School funding is very centrailzed, with the Ministry of Education providing more than 75 percent of school funding.
