Good Afternoon! My name is Won Lee, I am a research analyst at Center for Research on Educational Outcomes at Stanford University.
<br>  
<br> 
Today, I am going to present a paper that aims to examine how different Early Care and Education (ECE) subsidy designs affect the supply and price of services in the childcare market. This study is in early stage of the development, so results are largely preliminary. We hope to get some feedback on the structure of the analysis that we are doing. This is a work with Aaron Sojouner and Liz Davis at the University of Minnesota. 
<br> 
If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.

[Click]A large amount of studies find that childcare subsidies can increase human capital accumulation, especially for children from disadvantaged families.
<br>  
<br>
[Click]Many policymakers want to invest in childcare market but uncertainty remains about how public funding expansions of various designs would affect crowd-out, prices, and other outcomes that may be unintended. 
<br>  
<br>
 There has been much fewer studies on how different types of childcare funding policies affect the childcare market, which can help economists and policymakers predict trade-offs in subsidy design. 
<br>  
<br>
[Click]In this paper, we aim to study how funding changes in diﬀerent types of programs affects the market outcomes. We are in a good position to study this as the child care subsidies in Minnesota almost doubled between 2013 and 2017 from approximately <span>&dollar;</span>200 million to <span>&dollar;</span>400 million. This study is especially relevant and timely for Minnesota, because numerous different type of programs have been implemented, simultaneneously over the recent years.

[Click]Many studies have examined the effect of subsidies on changes in supply in the market.  Funding for child care subsidies found to increase number of providers.
<br>  
<br>
[Click] Only few but growing lierature have studied the system-level impacts. A number of studies examined effects of universal prekindergarten introductions on capacity of different market sectors in different states. 

 They found some evidence of crowdout of private capacity and suggest that there are unintented consequences of the policy on the market. 
<br>  
<br>
[Click]  Building on this literature, we believe that our study will add to the literature by disentangling effects of multiple policy programs under the complex policy environment. We also aims to examine effect on the price and quality in the market.

[Click]We use the NACCRAware's provider panal data from 2012-2015 from Minnesota Department of Human Services. 
The data contains information on capacity and price by agegroup-served, by provider type, and additional characteristics such as physical addresses, quality rating.
<br>
<br>
[Click]Policy data comes from various sources because there is no unified data system.
<br>
<br>We are gathering and combining the best-available data on each subsidy program, we want to measure how many dollars are flowing into each age group in each local market,  each year through each program.
<br>
<br>
[Click]Our primary analysis will focus on locales defined at school district boundaries because this will facilitate eventual
connection to child outcomes, such as student achievement.

Some more detail about the policy variables.
<br> 
<br> 
Early and regular Head start is the federal program that promotes the school readiness of low-income children. In 2017, there were about 12,000 slots in Head start, and 3000 slots in early head start. Funding amout is about 130 million annually.
<br>
<br>
CCDF is a program that offers financial help to low-income parents to pay for qualifying child care, about 26,000 children from birth up to age 5 particpated in 2016, and funding amount is about 110 million annually.
<br>
<br>
Minnesota was one of nine states awarded a federal Race to the Top. The 3 million is awarded annually to low-income children from birth to age five. The grant focused on serving families in four relatively-small
transformation zones.  The funding amount was relatively little, but, few communities experienced large changes from its termination in 2015.
<br>
<br> 
The Early Learning Scholarships Program was created in 2013 for children ages three to five. Scholarships are provided to low-income families sending their children to high-quality care providers as determined by the Parent Aware, Minnesota’s Quality Rating System. There are two pathways for allocating early learning scholarship funds.One that goes to the family directly as a voucher and they could use at any parent-aware rated provider, and the other one that goes to the provider to fund care of eligible children.
<br>
<br>
VPK is recently implemented in 2016, 86 school districts and charter schools provided vpk, that targets 4 year old children. Funding amount is about 22 million per year.
This does not enter our current analysis.
<br>
<br>
The state phased in full funding for all-day kindergarten during this period, which
may have pulled older children out of the childcare market. As we are focusing on childcare market outcomes,we
don't currently measure kindergarten enrollment as part of capacity.but, we include  All-Day-K funding  as a control variable.
<br>
<br>
So, basically, there has been various types of policy implemented during the recent period, and we try to measure how many dollars went into each agegroup and sector, that we use as treatment variables.

This table shows the school district year-level averages on harmonized subsidy amount broken down by type and age group targeted. The unit used in the table is 10,000 dollars. 
<br>
<br>
[Click]First, the average total funding amount that went into the school district are 750,000 dollars. 
<br>
<br>[Click] About 60 percent of the total funding belongs to the private funding, Private funding spent was 440,000 dollars vs 300,000 dollars for the public funding. 
<br>
<br>[Click]When funding is broken down by the targeted age-group, you can see that funding tagerged to the older group (3-5) is larger than the funding targeted to the younger group (0-2).

<br>
<br>

[Click] We also have the policy measures in "per child" unit, each children in the SD could have received 1,250 dollars. This number is per every children under age 5 including both eligible and non-eligible chlidren, if we look at per eligible child, the number goes up to about 7000 dollars.

Some description of outcome variables (quantity and price by age groups).
<br>
<br>[Click] There are on average 180 infant slots in a SD, 250 toddler and 554 preschool slots.
<br>
<br>[Click]
We break the overall slots by provider type and quality rating, which becomes one of the outcome variables.
<br>
<br>[Click]
For the price, Infant price is slightly higher than the preschool price, 
<br>
<br>[Click]and not surprisingly the center price is higher than the home-based provider price.

For each outcome, we estimate a generalized difference-in-differences model implemented with SD- and year- fixed effects,
<br>
<br>
[Click]Outcomes variables include, total slots, average price, and share highly-rated for local-year. we use it for overall and also by sector and age group.
<br>
<br>
[Click]Plt represents the policy of interest, ten thousands of dollars of local subsidy funding for the locale-year, by sector and agegroup. 
<br>
<br>
[Click]Xlt controls for all-day kindergarten funding. 
<br>
<br>
[Click]and, We have time and local fixed effects and the error term. 
<br>
Ideally, communities would be randomly assigned different levels of Policy funding, which is likely not the case. So, the identifying assumption is thatchanges in the funding amount within a local market is unrelated to the changes in the unobservables in the error term within the local market.

We consider these results preliminary as we await better policy and
more years of outcome data. That being said, we will interpret the results here just to give a flavor
for the kinds of interpretations we are hoping to inform. <br>
<br>
If you look at the first column of the table, The estimates suggest that an additional <span>&dollar;</span>10,000
in total funding for childcare subsidies increases total capacity by an average of 4.3 slots. It's not shown in the table but, 95% confidence interval for the estimate ranges from 1.1 to 7.1. The low end of this range seems quite
consistent with average childcare costs. The high-end could be plausible if subsidies
also drew in additional private resources, from parent co-pays and the like. This
effect combines a 2.8 slot effect on private providers, almost exclusively in centers,
and a 1.5 slot effect on public providers (Columns 2-5).
<br>
<br>
When total funding is split by sector, the private and public provider targeted funding, the effect of private-sector funding have a large positive effect 3.4 slot on private capacity, especially at centers. This is sensible as private-sector funding should increase demand for
private providers and, perhaps, additional subsidy opens up doors to centers for
families that would otherwise not be able to afford them. Family providers may not
be preferred by those with new options, as reflected in the small and statistically
insignificant effect.

		  <aside class="notes">
This is the results for price outcomes,baasically, we do not see much evidence of price changes but the weak evidence of change we do see is that more private funding lowers private prices, contrary to the theory that suggests subsidies to private providers increase their prices by increasing demand. This is not what we see in Table.
<br>
<br>
One story we have heard a lot is that increased funding for public provision of care for older children (All-Day-K and public-older) may skim the most-``profitable'' segment of the childcare market, breaking private providers' business model of cross-subsidizing infant care with older-child care. We don't see any effect of public-older or All-Day-K funding on infant care prices. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, there could be compositional effects on average prices as certain types of private providers are induced to exit or enter. We want to do analysis with provider fixed effects to gain more insight on this.

<br>
We are hesitant to draw any quick conclusion from these preliminary analysis,  
For the future analysis, we will improve the accuracy of the data by adding finer granular policy data from public agencies, we will also add more years of both policy and outcome data, which gives us more policy variation and statistical power for the estimates. The addition of the data will allow us to conduct more accurate age-group specific analysis.
