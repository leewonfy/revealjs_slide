Good Morning! Thank you for giving me the opportunity to be here to present my work. My name is Won Lee from Applied Economics department at the University of Minnesota. 
<br> 
<br> 
I am a applied micro-economist with research interests in the areas of education, labor and policy evaluation. I have mostly used quasi-experimental methods using micro-and spatial-data in my research.
<br> 
<br> 
Today, I am going to present impact evaluation study of truancy intervention program that has been implemented for about 20 years in an urban county in Minnesota and made over 13,000 referrals during this period. This is one of my dissertation chapters with my co-authors, Clea McNeely, Janet Rosenbaum, Lynette Rener, and Besu Alemu. 
<br> 
If you have any questions during the presentation, please feel free to interrupt me at any time.
I might cough at times, during the presentation. I aplogize for this in advance.

I want to begin by spending little time talking about the movitation and relevance behind this study. 

<br> 
[CLICK]First, Chrnoic absenteeism is persisting widespread problem in US. OVER 7 MILLION students have missed 15 or more school days in 2016 school year. Department of Education identified “chronic absenteeism” as a hidden educational crisis.
<br>  
<br> 
[CLICK]Schools and educators are increasingly expected to implement evidence-based interventions, schools are under significant pressure as a result of state and federal mandate to demonstrate improvements in academic outcomes including attendance.
<br> 
<br>
[CLICK]Also, in the truancy literature, There has been a demand for the rigorous evaluation of the truancy programs. Absenteeism research is spread across multiple disciplines, and much has focused on causes, correlates, and consequences rather than effects of interventions. 
<br>
Up to this point, There has been no test of effectiveness of large-scale truancy intervention programs in a real world setting, especially using population data.  
<br> 
<br>
[CLICK]This study is especially relevent and timely, as the court-diversion type program that we are evaluating is widely used across the school districts in U.S., about 60% are implementing the court-diversion programs, and recently, state of Texas and Tennessee mandated that all school districts implement court-diversion programs before petitioning to court for truancy case.

[CLICK]	Chronic absenteeism is defiend as, missing 15 or more school days within a school year, according to 2016 report from the department of education, 2.4 million elementary students are chronically absent, which is about 10% of total elementary students in U.S. 

<br> 
[CLICK]	Chronic Absenteeism is found to be corrected with numerous negative outcomes for both individual and the community. 

<br> 
	At the individual-level, it is found to be correlated with lower academic performance

<br>for example,  children who were chrnoically absent in first grade are much less likely to read in the third grade compared to the peers and children who fall behind the basic reading skills by the third grade are 4 times more likely to drop out of high school compared to the children with reading proficiency, 

<br> absenteeism is also correlated with anti-social behavior, substance abuse and negative labor market outcomes, 

<br> 
<br> 
	At the community-leve, all these negative outcomes for individauls can lead to lower tax revenue and higher crime rates

[CLICK]Some background about the truancy intervention in U.S., Societal response to reduce truancy go back as far as 19th century in U.S with enactment of compulsory education laws.  there has been tensions between concept of treatment and punishment in ways to respond to the truancy. 
<br> 

The pre-2010 correctional models mostly involved direct referral to family or juvenile court in response to absenteeism. but, due to the criticism that courts are primarily punitive and do not address the problems of the absence,

<br>

Schools have moved away from correctional models and now the most common type of intervention for chronic absenteeism is court diversion programs that combine 

<br>family education about the consequences of school absenteeism, a family-school contract to improve the childs attendance, and community-based services.

<br> 
Court diversion models are more theoretically sound than correctional models because they emphasize the importance of tackling multiple levels of students environment to improve school engagement. 
 
<br>


And yet, despite considerable efforts over the past 20 years, studies find that little progress has been made, the overall chronic absenteeism rates in the U.S. have been relative stable between 2002 and 2014 at 11 percent. 

<br>
<br>
and recent reviews of the lieterature find strikingly few evaluations of chronic absenteeism programs. and most peer-reviewed studies suffer from small sample size,  short-term follow-up, sample attrition, and dissimilar comparison
groups.

The program consists of three-steps.

<br>
<br>
[Click]	first step is the large group parent meeting after a student makes 5 or more unexcused absences, at the parent meeting, county attorney provide information about the negative consequences of the continued school absences, information about the program and eventual legal consequences. 

<br>
<br>
[Click]	After the first meeting, students' attendances are closely monitored by the school and those who makes additional 5 or more unexcused absnneces are referred to 2nd step of the program, where students and parents meet with county attorneys and community counselors where they try to find more detail cause of the continued truancy and form a written contract to improve the attendance. 

<br>
<br>
[Click]	If the unexcused abnseces continue after the  2nd step, the final step of the program involves referral to the child protection office or family-court, where parents may be court-ordered to comply with a case plan developed by court.

For the evaluation of the program, We use 12 years of student-year level data from multiple state agencies including department of education, department of human services, the unique feature of this dataset is that the multiple state agency data is linked across individuals over time, so it gives relatively rich information about the individual’s attendance history, academic performance as well as family background.
 
<br>

[Click]	We also use daily absentieesm data from five school-districts in the program county that distinquished unexcused from excused absences. Since we only have this data for the program county, we use this data to examine the short-term monthly-level effect of the program within an academic-year as a robustness check of the main results. 

<br>

[Click]	And finally, we use program data from county attorney's office with information on referral dates.

<aside class="notes">

[Click]The primary concern in program evaluation studies based on observational data is the problem of selection, that characteristics of referred students are likely to differ systematically from non-referred students in ways that affect future trajectories of attendance.

<br>
In order to mitigate these selection problem, we employ two strategies:

 
<br>
<br>

[Click]First, we construct comparison group through matching on pre-treatment individual-level characteristics. The comparison pool come from the adjacent county that did not have the similarly structured program, but faces very similar macro and demographic trends. 
 

<br>
The matching process ensures that the comparison group is characteristically quite similar to the treatment on all the observables. 

<br>
<br>
[Click]But, after mathcing, there still remains a room for selection on unobservables, such as student motivation and behavior, or parental support, so, in order to mitigate the selection, we use difference-in-difference method that leverages the panel data which difference out the time invariant unobservables in the error term.

To give you some idea on who is being referred to the program.
<br>
This table compares the student characteristics between referred and non-referred group in the program county. 

<br>Here the referred group are the 2nd to 5th graders who were referred to the program between 2006-2009, so there were fifteen-hundred(1500) referred students during the period and 60,000 non-referred students.

Not surprisingly, the referred students are quite difference from the rest of the population in terms of socio-demographic and school characteristics,

[Click]attendance rate of referred group is much lower, 89 percent attendance rate means students are missing 18 or more school days, which falls to the definition of chronic absenteeism.
<br>

<br>
[Click]Referred group are more likely to be free-lunch eligible, 87% of referred groups are free-lunch eligible, compared to 43% non-referred group, 

<br>
[Click]The referred group have about 4 times higher involvement with child protection service and [Click]out of home placement, compared to the non-referred students.
<br>
[Click]Appriximately half of the referred students were Black students and students of color comprised nearly 81% of the total referred group, compared to 52% of the non-referred group.  

<br>
These information shows the student referred to the program are highly disadvantaged children.

Red dots represent covariate balance before matching. Blue dots after matching.

So in general red dots are quite scattered, which suggests that before matching, there are large characteristics difference between treated and comparison group.

the purpose of matching is to eliminate these large differences in group characteristics and contain differences under the conventional level of threshold, which is represented by the outter dotted vertical line.

Compared to the estimates from the naive OLS model, the  program effect from the DID model was close to zero and statistically insignificant at conventional

[Click]So, to summarize the study, The results of our study shows that the program did not have a positive effect on improving the attendance of the referred students, either in the short-term or up to four years after program referral.
<br>
<br>
[Click]We observe some degree of "regression to the mean" or transitory nature of absence, suggesting absence is often clustered at certain points in time within the academic year.  we argue that this is the important issue to be addressed in any types of evaluation study of absentieesm intervention program. <br> 
Because this can be the systematic cause of bias in the field when counterfactual is not carefully constructed. <br> 
  The magnitude of bias may be larger when the follow-up period is limited to short period of time, especially within a school year.

The biggest limitation of this study is that there is no good measure of implementation of the program, which make it  difficult to disentangle whether the null findings are due to program contents, implementation fidelity, or both.

 
<br>
<br>

Second, for the main analysis of the study, we used yearly attendance data that aggregates unexcused and excused absences, so we could not evaluate whether the program affected the long-term trajectory of unexcused absences, which this program really targets.

<aside class="notes">
	So, a couple of policy implications drawn from the findings of this study and the based on the review of the literature.
 <br>
	First, we would argue that there needs to be more critical evaluation of existing policy across the nation, to ensure that current practices are truly of benefit to the students and schools who are the recipients of those procedures. 

 <br>
   The evidence suggests that a variety of different types of programs can be successful. But, As with all programs, the quality of implementation seems critical.  

 <br> 
Working with school districts to find systematic ways to track implementation fidelity, and collect information from parents’ and students’ about their experiences with the truancy diversion program would be beneficial for future evaluation purposes.

 <br> 
We noticed the large proportion of the managemnet work was conducted manually including coding of absences and program referral, this adds burden of extra paperworks to the already busy school administrators,
We suggest implementation of online-based application tools that allows administrators to streamline management of the program, 

 <br> 
 real-time activity monitoring and reporting enables to keep the quality of implementation up to certain standards, and timely interventions., this is already widely used strategy in many school programs and have shown to be effective.

<aside class="notes"> 
Additionally, I think it is important to design the intervention to maximize the personal contact and relationships.
 <br> 
 <br>
Few programs that are shown to be highly-effective in improving the school engagement has the common feature of some type of mentor-mentee relationship with the children and family. so, there is usually one individual who
is responsible for ensuring multiple students connects with school, the mentor person can be a parent, program staff, teacher or even police officers.
 <br> 
 <br>
  Right now, the court diversion programs consists of, basically as a set of services lacking the relationship component. The relationship-intensive program is expensive and difficult to scale, but I think it is important to think about a cost-effective way to bring in this connection in to the diversion models. 
<br> 
<br>
there is a emerging literature in behavioral economics that sending series of encouragement text messages to parents or guardians affects child attendance in a postive way. This type of intervention could be an cost-effective direction that schools can test using experimental design.
